LeoChatProgram - a very basic client/server chat program made by Leotrix

This program works simply by having a host/server machine and client machine talk to each other through basic socket input/output. You must have the server launcher running on the host machine before attempting to connect to the host machine with the client launcher.

Launching LeoChatProgram on console:
1. Open up a terminal/command prompt.
2. Type in 'java -jar *CLIENT/SERVER LAUNCHER HERE*' and enter.
3. To exit in console chat, simply enter '/exit'.

Both client and server have two different versions. The GUI/graphical version and the console version.
Graphical Client Launcher - GUI_Client.jar
Graphical Server Launcher - GUI_Server.jar
Console Client Launcher - ConsoleClient.jar
Console Server Launcher - ConsoleServer.jar

Also something neat about this program is that a graphical client can talk to a console server and vice versa. There is no limitation on which type of launcher you decide to use on either end.

Currently the server can only communicate to one client and not multiple clients. I may add this in as a feature later on or in a different project. The aim of this program was to make a simple chat strictly between two machines.

I made this as my Java Client/Server assignment for my Diploma of Software Developement course. Please feel free to pick at it and report any issues you have! :-)
